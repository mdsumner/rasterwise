# weird.nc

The goal of weird.nc is to collect illustrative NetCDF files so our R code works right. 

Files are put into "extdata/", and then a script is run to 

* archive all the files in extdata/ as a tarball
* generate a record of the list of files
* commit to the repo and tag the release
* push the tarball artefact out into the Releases files (using R's piggyback)

I put the stars issue number into the folder name https://github.com/r-spatial/stars/issues

There are some weird and wonderful files in the extdata/ on their own, from my personal collections. 


## The list

```{r, echo=FALSE}
writeLines(readLines("weirdlist.txt"))
```
